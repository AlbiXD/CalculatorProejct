# CalculatorProejct

This calculator was the final project for my Data Structures and Algorithms using stacks, scenebuilder and a few files provided by the professor in order to follow algebraic PEMDAS order and converts from infix to postfix. 


Known Bugs:
  - Square Root function is not working currently as I have not programmed its function
